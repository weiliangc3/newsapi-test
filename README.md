# Newsapi Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses the news api to achieve a bunch of things.

## Getting Started

Create a file `.env.local` with the api key. An example has been provided in `.env.local-example`.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

- Bootstrapped ✅
- See the latest news ❌
- Ability to filter by keywords (see everything endpoint api) ❌
- If the user clicks on a news item it will navigate to a page displaying the full news article selected. ❌
- Has tests (Interaction/e2e?) ❌

## Notes

I took some time bootstrapping this because I need to do this at some point for myself anyway. My other project doesn't use next, nor jest - so I'm going to fork this repo for myself to use as a springboard. (See [here](https://github.com/weiliangc3/nextjs-typescript-tooled)).
